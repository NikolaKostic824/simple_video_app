Venezuela is located in front of the beautiful Caribbean Sea in¬†South¬†America (At north of South America), its food culture is well influenced by european, african and native flavours that evolved within generations. Each region has a unique way to prepare and present our traditional food. Arepas and Empanadas¬†are well known culinary¬†expressions in Venezuela. Both are made out of white or yellow corn flour and that is the reason why they are gluten free. At Anytime Arepa we offer a simple¬†menu, our recipes are inspired by our family mothers and grandmothers. We were born in Caracas, Venezuela's capital city. We grew up enjoying those aromas and learning (without knowing) how to cook and replicate flavors and combine ingredients. Today, we are proud of our mission that started here in the Midwest in 2018 when we began to spread¬†the word about our food and culture and the amazing food¬† that you can find in Latin America. We always serve fresh food because¬†that is how we grew up. Now it is our turn to spread the magic and introduce you to our version of Venezuelan Arepas and Empanadas. Check our menu and get excited! Get curious and hungry! Come and visit us at the 3rd. Street Market Hall and Zocalo Food Park, right here in the \"Good Land\", Milwaukee, WI",

At work and at home, Betty was known for her intense love, loyalty, and ability to make any stranger feel like family. She didn‚Äôt have a lot, but she had her boys and practiced a ‚ÄúWhatever It Takes‚Äù approach to balancing the demands of running restaurants with the demands of raising 3 sons alone. Loving and leading her family while setting an example of her tireless work ethic is what drove her to excel in all the Mexican restaurants that she was a part of.Passing in 2010, Betty had instilled in her sons the passion for family, work, and Mexican food! Though she is no longer with us, her love for her family, her guests, and the food will forever live on. Her work is done, but her passion for Mexican food lives on. Nothing is more powerful than a mother's love. Betty was a testament to that. Mama Betty's is named after Betty Carrier, but is a tribute to all mothers - All women who put their family first and have the \"Whatever It Takes\" approach to their family. We are all here because of them, and Mama Betty's is here to honor them. ¬°Salud!",

    "description": "Welcome to Gangnam Korean BBQ Restaurant and Bar, where the American dream meets the vibrant flavors of Korean cuisine. Our story is one of resilience, perseverance, and a deep love for both food and family.  Our founders, Mr. and Mrs. Oh, embarked on a remarkable journey, leaving behind their homeland in search of new opportunities. They migrated to the United States with nothing but a few dollars and an unyielding determination to build a better future for themselves and their children.  Arriving in a foreign land where English was not their first language, the Ohs faced numerous challenges. Language barriers and cultural differences posed obstacles, but their unwavering spirit pushed them to overcome each one. They worked tirelessly, starting from the ground up, taking on low-paying jobs that demanded long hours and offered little respite.  Despite the hardships, the Ohs held onto their dreams of entrepreneurship. They saved every penny they could, often working multiple labor-intensive jobs simultaneously just to make ends meet. Their resilience fueled their ambition, and slowly but steadily, they managed to accumulate enough savings to invest in a small business.  The road to success was not an easy one for the Ohs. They faced failures, setbacks, and moments of doubt along the way. However, through sheer determination and a strong belief in the authentic flavors of their homeland, they persevered.  With their relentless passion for Korean cuisine, the Ohs decided to introduce Americans to the rich and diverse world of Korean BBQ. They opened their first location in SW Houston, aptly named Bon Korean BBQ, where they poured their hearts and souls into creating an unforgettable dining experience.  Their commitment to authenticity paid off, as Bon Korean BBQ quickly gained popularity and a loyal following. Recognizing the growing demand for Korean cuisine, the Ohs set their sights on expanding their culinary empire to Austin, a city known for its vibrant food scene.  And so, Gangnam Korean BBQ Restaurant and Bar was born. Inspired by the bustling energy of Seoul's Gangnam district, the restaurant captures the essence of Korean culture in every detail. From the warm and welcoming ambiance to the sizzling grills that bring flavors to life, Gangnam Korean BBQ invites guests to embark on a culinary adventure.  The Ohs' incredible journey, marked by sacrifice and triumph, serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and the pursuit of one's dreams. They are proud to share the authentic tastes of Korea with Americans, ensuring that the vibrant flavors and communal spirit of Korean BBQ are experienced by all.  So join us at Gangnam Korean BBQ Restaurant and Bar, where the road to success may have been challenging, but the rewards are mouthwateringly delicious. We invite you to savor the flavors, embrace the culture, and become a part of our family as we continue to share the wonders of Korean cuisine with the world.",
